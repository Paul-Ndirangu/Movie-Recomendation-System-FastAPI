## Movie Recommendation System Backend (FastAPI + PyTorch)

This repository houses the backend of a movie recommendation system built using FastAPI and PyTorch. It leverages collaborative filtering techniques to recommend movies to users based on their preferences and the preferences of similar users.

### Features

* **Collaborative Filtering**: Employs both user-based and item-based collaborative filtering algorithms to generate personalized recommendations.
* **FastAPI**: Provides a robust and performant RESTful API for interacting with the model and its recommendations.
* **PyTorch**: Utilizes the flexibility and power of PyTorch for model training and inference.
* **Scalability**: Designed to be easily scalable to accommodate growing user base and data volume.

### Getting Started

**1. Prerequisites:**

- Python 3.7+
- pipenv or virtualenv
- PyTorch
- FastAPI

**2. Installation:**

1. Clone the repository.
2.  `cd backend`
3. Create a virtual environment and activate it.
    **Linux**
    `virtualenv venv`
    Activate virtual environment
    `source venv/bin/activate`
    **Windows**

4. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install required dependencies.
5. Start the API server with `uvicorn main:app --reload`.

**3. API Endpoints:**

- `/recommend`: Takes user ID and number of recommendations as input, returns a list of recommended movie IDs.
- `/user/:user_id`: Gets information about a specific user.
- `/movie/:movie_id`: Gets information about a specific movie.

**4. Documentation:**

Refer to the `docs` directory for detailed API documentation generated by Swagger.

### Model Training

1. Download a movie dataset (e.g., MovieLens).
2. Prepare the data for training (e.g., feature engineering, user-item matrix creation).
3. Implement and train the chosen collaborative filtering model (e.g., Matrix Factorization).
4. Save the trained model for use in inference.
